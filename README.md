# 💉 Healink – Smart IV Monitoring App

Healink is a real-time monitoring application designed to display IV fluid levels, visualize patient infusion data, and notify medical staff about critical conditions through an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
IV monitoring systems generate sensor data, but without a proper interface:
- Medical staff cannot easily track multiple patients  
- Critical alerts may be missed  
- Data is not centrally visualized  

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design an application that:
- Displays IV fluid level in real time  
- Visualizes patient infusion data  
- Sends alerts for critical levels  
- Enables remote monitoring  

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time IV level dashboard  
- Patient-wise monitoring view  
- Threshold-based alerts  
- Visual status indicators  
- Simple and intuitive UI  

---

## 🖥️ App Functionalities
- Live fluid level graph  
- Bottle status (Normal / Low / Critical)  
- Alert notifications  
- Patient ID tracking  
- Historical data view  

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Node-RED / Web Dashboard  
- Firebase / ThingSpeak  
- REST API / MQTT  
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (if web)  
- Flutter / React Native (if mobile)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- IV monitoring device sends sensor data via Wi-Fi  
- Data is received by cloud/database  
- Healink app fetches data in real time  
- App displays:
  - Fluid level  
  - Patient status  
- When threshold is crossed:
  - App triggers notification  
  - Status is highlighted  

---

## 🏥 Applications
- Hospital nurse stations  
- ICU dashboards  
- Remote patient monitoring  
- Home healthcare systems  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Push notifications to nurse mobiles  
- Multi-patient ward dashboard  
- Role-based access (Doctor/Nurse/Admin)  
- AI-based infusion prediction  
- Integration with hospital systems
